# Site Claim

Basically, a slash command. System and 3 letter sig for a site

That logs it in auth, and posts in a separate channel

- 2 buttons on that message: run by us, run by others

Then some kind of simple ui in auth, even just a spreadsheet export would be fine
Want to pay someone if they scouted a site and it got run
